README file for reproducibility check
Targeting in Tax Compliance Interventions: Experimental Evidence from Honduras (Giselle del Carmen, Edgardo Henrique Espinal Hernandez and Thiago Scot)


1. FOLDER STRUCTURE

The reproducibility package includes the following folders:

	a. FinalCode: Stata do-files + R script to reproduce all results in the paper, including a master do-file

	b. Inputs: folder containing all raw datasets used to produce results. This folder is populated with original datasets and is not changed by the code. The original datasets are the following:

		b.1 "Baseline_experiment.csv": Dataset with "baseline" data. This is a dataset at the taxpayer-level, provided by the Tax Authority, containing (anonymized) information on individual taxpayers behavior before 2020. This was used to determine the study sample, perform the randomization and test for balance at baseline.

		b.2 "Endline_experiment.csv": "Endline" dataset. This dataset is also at the taxpayer level, provided by the Tax Authority, and contains information from their 2020 income tax filings - our main outcomes of interest.

		b.3 "AdditionalInfo_endline.csv": Supplemental dataset with other information at taxpayer level in 2020 (such as total monthly sales taxes declared) provided by the Tax Authority.

		b.4 "Pilot_dataset.xlsx": Dataset containing the results from a small experiment, implemented in late 2019, to assess the impact of sending emails to taxpayers. The results of this pilot are discussed in Annex B.

		b.5 "ExpertSurvey_dataset.csv": Dataset containing the responses from experts forecasting the experimental results. The survey was implemented in Qualtrics, filled online and data downloaded on June 1st, 2020.


	c. output: This folder contains all intermediary and final datasets for analysis. This folder is empty before running the code.

	d. out: this folder contains all tables and graphs generated by the code (separately stored in the "Figures" and "Tables" subfolders). It also contains the paper's tex file - after running the code, it should be possible to compile the tex file and obtain the draft shared with the DIME Analytics team. Additionally, this folder contains a subfolder with additional images used in the paper but not generated by the code, as follows:
		d.1 FlowChart.png (Figure 1 in the paper)
		d.2 8 pdf files containing the emails sent to taxpayers (Figures 8-14)
		d.3 "Questionnaire_Qualtrics.pdf", the questionnaire used for the expert survey (Appendix E)

In the main folder you should also find:
	a. The filled reproducibility checklist
	b. The original paper draft
	c. This README file



2. RUNNING THE CODE

I have included in the "FinalCode" folder all code necessary to replicate the paper from the raw databases. The master do-file "0_Master_experiment.do" is the only do-file you should need to run: it will execute all Stata do-files as well as one R-script (use the estimate the Random Forest model). 

Executing this Master do-file on my computer (MacBook pro with Mac OS 8gb RAM) took approximately 11 mins (less than 2 min to run the entire Stata section but 9 minutes to run the random forest model in R).


3. COMMENTS ON THE CODE

The code definitely falls short of some of the recommendations on the Reproducibility guidelines. In particular, the cleaning code is not thoroughly documented, so I'm sure someone reading the code from scratch will not understand every data cleaning or variable creation decision. The analysis part is much better documented, so a reader should be able to fully understand where each Table and Figure from the paper is coming from. 

Since the vast majority of the code is in Stata, I have a Stata master do-file that calls the R-script using the command -rscript - (ssc install commented in the beginning of the master do-file). If anything goes wrong in the reproducibility check in terms of running the code from scratch, I'd guess it will involve this command not working (haven't really tried in other computer but my own...). Please let me know if it doesn't work and I'll do my best to fix it.
